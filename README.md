# 🐾 Pet Age Calculator

A responsive, theme-aware web app that converts pet years to human years—and vice versa—for dogs and cats. Built as a modern portfolio project to showcase front-end development, form handling, dark mode theming, and clean UI/UX with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

  Simple but effective validation with inline error handling.
